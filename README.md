## JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR NETWORK STATE

In Network States, individuals join via a social contract, agreeing on rules of conduct. But, misbehaviour results in disqualification. These instances of conflicts demands a justice system for fair resolution. Enter Justice Protocol, a solution to this challenge. Justice Protocol sets out rules for decentralised dispute resolution, seamlessly integrating into any Network State. Essentially, we've crafted the Justice Component, offering a transparent, efficient, and adaptable mechanism for conflict resolution which any Network States can plug-in. The rules of resolution on which justice is rendered may be decided by each Network State.

## DECENTRALISED JUSTICE FOR NATION STATE

While we're working towards creating fully anonymous and sovereign Network States, we recognize the immediate need for justice implementation in Nation States. In the interim, Justice Protocol offers a practical solution to address significant problems within Nation States. Foreg. India, is plagued by a centralised legal system, with bias & corruption in judge appointments. It has a backlog of 40 Million cases with only 17,000 judges, Justice Protocol creates an alternative to state based resolution, on-chain, by entrusting lawyers with role of judges. Adjudication to evidence storage & decision-making is handled on-chain, ensuring reliability in lawyer-based adjudication. This accelerates resolution AND establishes sustainable revenue for the 1.2 million lawyers in India ( who otherwise have monthly avg revenue of 0-15,000 INR). The flexibility of online resolution is particularly advantageous for women and specially-abled practitioners.

Even though decisions are not made by state-appointed judges, since our model follows arbitral rules ( including NY Convention), decisions are recognised by the legal system.

Although we're building JUSTICE PROTOCOL for NETWORK STATEs, its designed so that Nation State citizens can also access decentralised justice
